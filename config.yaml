  site_description:
    - "This project periodically monitors the operational status of cloud.dify.ai by interacting with pre-built apps and knowledge bases via the API, simulating real user operations. Results are accumulated and displayed here."
    - "This is an unofficial project and is not affiliated with or supported by LangGenius."
    - "No guarantees are made regarding the accuracy of the results, and no responsibility is assumed."
    - "This project runs on GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages. Data gaps may occur due to GitHub-side outages."
    - "Since all component checks use the API, any API outage will cause all API-dependent checks to fail."
    - "Pro plan checks may stop working after around July 2026 due to the subscription period ending."
